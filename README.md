# LAIG-Project-FEUP

A project for the LAIG course (Graphical Applications Laboratory).  
LAIG is a 3rd year, 1st semester course (more info here:  
https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=420004).  
  
The project consists of 3 sub-projects of increasing complexity and difficulty.

Third project

The final project consists on the development of a graphical interface for a game.  
The logical component of the game had already been developed in another ![course](https://github.com/susanalima/FEUP-PLOG), 
by Susana Lima (![susanalima](https://github.com/susanalima)) and Gon√ßalo Santos (![gregueiras](https://github.com/gregueiras)).

The game has multiple difficulty levels, PvP/PvC/CvC (P-Player; C-Computer) modes, animated game pieces, 2 different scenes (space and garden),
animated timers and markers, game menu and multiple toggable light sources.
